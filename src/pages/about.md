# About This Campaign

Singer-songwriter and activist Billy Bragg has been advocating the secondary mandate as a viable form of democratic Lords reform since giving evidence to the Royal Commission on Reform of the House of Lords in 1999. In 2001 he produced a 6000 word pamphlet on the issue entitled ‘A Genuine Expression of the Will of the People’ (a copy of which can be downloaded here).

This campaign website is written and funded by him.
